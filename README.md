# RMarkdownCV

My personal CV as a suite of RMakrdown files

CV data are stored as a YAML file named "CVcontents.yml", which is used by the R code within the RMarkdown file (chunks) to generate the CVs.

Multilingual support is possible. The current version has CV data for English (lang == en) and French (lang == fr), but any others may be added.

There two CV versions:

Academic
: A detailed, academic-style, CV with full achievement lists, for folks who do not fear reading.

Corporate
: A more succinct version for the corporate world.

Please, feel free to adapt this CV to your own needs and propose changes.
